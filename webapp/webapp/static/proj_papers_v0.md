## Meta note: Criteria for an initial list of curated projects 

* Have been around for at least few years, i.e. had time to gather some citation
* Have some citation, i.e. we don't want flowers to look barren and sparse
* Have a local author/champion, who can give input on paper selection and interpreting results. 
* Span different topics in CECS and ANU
